# Hi there 👋, I'm Austin

I’m a full-stack developer based in Wellington, New Zealand, focused on building web applications and tools that prioritize utility and solve real human problems. I love creating complex systems from single moving parts.

## ⭐ About Me

I studied at an intensive 17-week bootcamp totalling 900 hours at DevAcademy, where I learnt to build full-stack web applications using technologies such as React, Node.js and TypeScript. I'm especially interested in building clean, efficient systems that are maintainable and scalable for future devs/teams.

Outside of programming I'm a movie-lover and maker. I think there’s nothing more satisfying than turning an idea into an experience.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

A bit of everything! But moving ahead my main focus are raw SQL, AWS, and starting to learn low-level languages like C.

## 🔭 I'm Currently Working On

You can find POCKETPa. at [https://pocketpa.film](https://pocketpa.film).

POCKETPa. is an in-development app that combines my passion for tech and film. It aims to provide convenient, useful tools for low/no-budget student filmmakers, substituting some of the tasks a paid Production Assistant (PA) would have on a professional film production. This has been a great experience and has reinforced my skills in the stack taught at DevAcademy. The Front-end uses React and React Query, while the Back-end uses an Express.js server and Knex.js database queries/schemas.
