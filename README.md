# Hi there üëã, I'm Austin

I‚Äôm a full-stack developer based in Wellington, New Zealand, focused on building web applications and tools that prioritize utility and solve real human problems. I love creating complex systems from single moving parts.

## ‚≠ê About Me

I studied at an intensive 17-week bootcamp totalling 900 hours at DevAcademy, where I learnt to build full-stack web applications using technologies such as React, Node.js and TypeScript. I'm especially interested in building clean, efficient systems that are maintainable and scalable for future devs/teams.

Outside of programming I'm a movie-lover and maker. I think there‚Äôs nothing more satisfying than turning an idea into an experience.

## üå± I‚Äôm Currently Learning

A bit of everything! But moving ahead my main new focuses are raw SQL, AWS, .NET, and starting to learn low-level languages like C.

## üî≠ I'm Currently Working On

### POCKETPa.

</p>


You can find POCKETPa. at [https://pocketpa.film](https://pocketpa.film).

POCKETPa. is an in-development app that combines my passion for tech and film. It aims to provide convenient, useful tools for low/no-budget student filmmakers, substituting some of the tasks a paid Production Assistant (PA) would have on a professional film production. This has been a great experience and has reinforced my skills in the stack taught at DevAcademy. The Front-end uses React and React Query, while the Back-end uses an Express.js server and Knex.js database queries/schemas.

## üóÇÔ∏è Previous Projects
(Ordered by most recent)

### SkillSwap
In the fifteenth week of DevAcademy we'd learnt to use technologies across the full stack, and we were given a full week to make our final project. I worked in a group of four to create 'SkillSwap', a beginner-friedly code forum with questions, answers, profiles, messaging and video calls. We aimed to create the best user experience for our target users, prioritising simplicity and intuitive use over completeness. We weren't creating a thorough library of coding knowledge, we were creating a place to introduce new people to code.

### Butterfly News
Ten weeks into DevAcademy the cohort was learning how to make use of external APIs with HTTP requests and server proxy routes. For this week's group project, I led a group of five students to make 'Butterfly News', a time-traveling news website. We made use of the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) to get news stories from any date the user 'traveled to' and display them to the user. We also allowed the user to input a way they would change the past. Following this we'd 'return them to the present', calling Google's [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to make up a funny story about how the Butterfly Effect would had changed the present, displaying this as it's own news story among real stories The New York Times had published in the past week.

### JS Calculator

Six weeks into DevAcademy I tried my hand at making a JavaScript scientific calculator, this project was never finished, and I managed to make a mess of my code but it's safe to say since this point I've focused on learning clean, maintainable coding practices. This project involved creating a syntax parser, recursive evaluation of brackets inside expressions, managing input validadation, inserting implicit multiplication operators, and many more things. My skills have improved hugely since here, but it's interesting to look back at.

My JS-Calculator repository can be found [here](https://github.com/austin-butters/JS-Calculator).

### Rubik's Cube
This was a small personal project when I started learning JavaScript for practice. It features a flattened view of a Rubik's Cube that can be mixed up and solved by the user with the keyboard. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/austin-butters/rubiks-cube).

### Foundations Blog
In the first few weeks of DevAcademy I made a static site using only HTML and CSS for my 'Foundations Blog'. I used media queries to make the site responsive to different screen sizes.
The repository can be found at [https://github.com/austin-butters/austin-butters.github.io](https://github.com/austin-butters/austin-butters.github.io). The live site can be found at [https://austin-butters.github.io/](https://austin-butters.github.io/).
