I studied at an intensive 17-week bootcamp totalling 900 hours at DevAcademy, where I learnt to build full-stack web applications using technologies such as React, Node.js and TypeScript. I'm especially interested in building clean, efficient systems that are maintainable and scalable for future devs/teams.

Outside of programming I'm a movie-lover and maker. I think thereâ€™s nothing more satisfying than turning an idea into an experience.
